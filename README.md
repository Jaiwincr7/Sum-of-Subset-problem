<b>Theory</b>:- An array a[ ] is given with size 'n'. Sum of Subset problem provides us with the contiguous subset of the array which provides us with maximum sum that a array can provide to the user. Subset can be of any size as problem may contain negative number which might decrease the maximum sum of the array.
